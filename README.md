# ProtonMail Bridge for ARM

This repository is a fork of the official [ProtonMail Bridge](https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge) but designed to be built for ARM architecture

The license can be found in [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file, for more licensing information see [COPYING_NOTES](./COPYING_NOTES.md).


## Description of this fork

The ProtonMail Bridge is open source, but the last working version with ARM architecture was the version 1.4.5.

The version 1.4.5 is no longer supported on the ProtonMail server side. Thus a new version working for ARM is needed.
